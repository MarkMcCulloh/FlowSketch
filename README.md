### Workflow Description
How to Start:

1. Update Android Studio to the newest version

2. Create new project in Android Studio by cloning this repo

3. Create your own branch (call it name-dev, such as mark-dev)

*Note: These can be done in Android Studio*


How to Work:

1. Pull to update your branch with latest master changes

3. Push to your Branch (remote)

4. Put in a Pull Request (to merge your remote branch with the remote master branch)

6. Repeat steps 1 - 5 until project is done
